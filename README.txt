Responsive dynamic image and gallery viewer

== Description ==

Chroma Lightbox for dynamic loading and viewing of images and galleries, without the need for a browser refresh.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `chroma-lightbox` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on Settings/Chroma Lightbox to access the plugin setup page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work?

Chroma Lightbox will detect any clicks on links that point to an image bitmap. Instead of sending the browser to the image, Chroma Lightbox will display the image in a dynamic floating window. Chroma lightbox can also scan the post/page for other images and allow you to browse them without leaving the Lightbox.

= Will this work on my theme? =

At default settings, Lightbox will work with any image links that contain an image bitmap. The gallery feature will work if your theme uses that standard ".entry-content" class wrapper for displaying posts/pages. This wrapper class can be redefined in Chroma Lightbox settings.
